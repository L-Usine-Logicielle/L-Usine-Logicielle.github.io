The Moodle Grades Scraper project is a collaborative initiative between me and my classmate Lucas Perfeito. Using web scraping on our school‚Äôs Moodle website, we‚Äôve set up an alert system, via Discord or by e-mail, to inform our classmates when a new note is added or modified. The script used for this project is hosted on our own servers.

This project is designed with Python üêç for the script part, Docker üê≥ for the deployement part and MariaDB for the storage part. Alerts can be send by e-mail or with Discord notifications (via a webhook), as shown in the following images.
